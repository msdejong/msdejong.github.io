I am currently a PhD student at the University of Southern California, advised by Fei Sha. At a high level, I am interested in neural network inductive biases that encourage compositional generalization. In practice my recent work has studied how to incorporate information from a text corpus into a neural model and how best to combine and reason over this information.

In my free time, I like reading, standup comedy, escape rooms and competitive gaming.
